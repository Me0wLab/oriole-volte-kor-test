# oriole-volte-kor-test

## Test Device
* Pixel 6
* SKTelecom

## ROMs to test
* CalyxOS
* ProtonAOSP 

## TODO
- [x] CalyxOS (Official Build supports VOLTE without modding)
> Official CalyxOS Build supports VOLTE without modifying build.prop.

> Cause: Wrong APN
- [x] ProtonAOSP
> Doesn't provide Proprietary files Extraction tools yet.

> Successfully built with aosp_oriole-user and VOLTE Provisioning enabled but, VOLTE doesn't work.

> Possible Causes: Missing Proprietary files provided by Google, Wrong APN

- [ ] GrapheneOS
> Doesn't support VOLTE by default
> 
> When Sandboxed Play Service's Geolocation API is implemented, I'll try building it.
